## Installation

You can install masterepir from this repository with

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("malcolmbarrett/masterepir")
```

`masterepir::use_module()` will install the materials for a given module on your computer. Then, it will open a new RStudio Project containing the files you'll need.

``` r
masterepir::use_module("module_name")
```

By default, this package downloads the materials to a conspicuous place like your Desktop. You can also tell `use_module()` exactly where to put the materials with `destdir`:

``` r
masterepir::use_module("module_name", destdir = "a/path/on/your/computer")
```
