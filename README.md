## Installation

You can install masterepir from this repository with

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("malcolmbarrett/masterepir")
```

`masterepir::install_course()` will install the course materials on your
computer. Then, it will open a new RStudio Project containing the files
youâ€™ll need.

``` r
masterepir::install_course()
```

By default, this package downloads the materials to a conspicous place
like your Desktop. You can also tell `install_course()` exactly where to
put the materials with `destdir`:

``` r
masterepir::install_course(destdir = "a/path/on/your/computer")
```
